# Nibu CultCache Target Critic Prompt

You are reviewing one target lowering produced from the Nibu interlingua packet.

## Source

- Interlingua packet:
  `examples/english-lowering/nibu-proof-001/interlingua.yaml`
- Projected context:
  `examples/english-lowering/nibu-proof-001/projected-context.yaml`
- Lowering prompt:
  `prompts/nibu-cultcache-target-lowering.md`
- CultCache profile store:
  `.weksa/cultural-ontology/starter-targets.cc`

The source meaning is:

- Nibu warns the player not to touch a damaged ship control.
- Touching it may endanger the player.
- Nibu is protective but abrasive, precise, technical, and resistant to generic
  assistant gentleness.

## Critic Task

Review only the target file assigned in your task. Do not edit the target
lowering file. Write one critique file at the assigned path.

Evaluate:

- meaning preservation
- target cultural ontology obedience
- naturalness/plausibility for the target
- whether Nibu's voice survived the target lens
- overreach, stereotype, caricature, or unlicensed flavor
- trace quality: axes, affordances, rejected affordances, forbidden flattenings

If you recommend a revision, provide exactly one proposed `spoken_text` and
explain why it is better. If the original should stand, say so clearly.
