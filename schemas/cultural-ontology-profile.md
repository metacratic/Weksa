# Cultural Ontology Profile Contract

This is the human-facing schema receipt for
`weksa.cultural_ontology_profile.v0`, the CultCache document family that stores
reviewed cultural ontology used during utterance lowering.

Executable schema code does not exist yet. When it does, it must reconcile with
this receipt, the meta-analysis paper, and the profiles under
`data/target-language-ontology/`.

## Authority

A cultural ontology profile owns the realization lens for a target speech
community, dialect, register, regional overlay, ritual register, historical
period, or contact-language repertoire.

It owns:

- salience axes the lowerer must inspect
- social-indexical meanings attached to forms
- linguistic affordances available to a dialect or register
- activation gates and forbidden use contexts
- evidence, reviewer status, uncertainty, and source hashes
- trace requirements for lowering audits

It does not own:

- source meaning
- speaker identity
- final wording without an interlingua packet
- unreviewed stereotypes
- Qdrant nearest-neighbor results as accepted truth
- renderer-specific surface tricks

## State Shape

The profile is typed state whose nested fields are also typed state. Lists of
strings may be used only as summaries or indexes; accepted affordance authority
lives in feature records.

```yaml

## Affordance Feature Records

Every affordance list above contains typed feature records. Feature IDs should
be stable inside a profile and reusable in lowering traces.

```yaml

  layer: grammar | phonology | lexicon | discourse | orthography | code_switching

Specialized feature records add fields rather than replacing the common record:

## Lowering Trace Contract

A lowered utterance trace should cite the nested state that actually affected
the line:

```yaml
cultural_ontology_trace:
  activated_profiles: []
  activated_axes:
    - axis_id:
      distinctions_used: []
      distinctions_rejected: []
  activated_affordances:
    - profile_id:
      layer:
      feature_id:
      density:
      reason:
      evidence_refs: []
  rejected_affordances:
    - profile_id:
      layer:
      feature_id:
      reason:
  reviewer_required:
  uncertainty: []
```

## Storage

Recommended CultCache paths:

```text
.weksa/cultural-ontology/{profileId}.cc
.weksa/cultural-ontology/{baseProfileId}/overlays/{overlayId}.cc
.weksa/cultural-ontology/catalogs/{catalogId}.cc
.weksa/cultural-ontology/evidence-bundles/{bundleId}.cc
```

Qdrant may store chunks, vectors, and payload filters for retrieval. It does
not own profile acceptance, feature activation, or renderer authority.
